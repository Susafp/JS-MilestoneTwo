# Allergens-Quiz-Milestone Two

This Quiz App is my second project for the Frontend Developer Course. 
Having close relations in the Catering professional area I am aware of the importance of having well trained staff on all aspect's food related, being food allergies one of the most important ones.
Many thousands of people in the UK, both children and adults, have allergies, and it’s important that they’re able to go about their day-to-day lives in safety, which means that those working with food need to be equipped with the right knowledge.
This Quiz can be used to complement the training, usually provided by employers. It can work as a light and fun way to remind their staff about this important aspect of food preparation.
This game is aimed at people that already have a basic knowledge on food allergens, most questions offer hidden tips and/or important complementary information about the subject.
When playing, the user will find 4 answer options per each question. For every correct answer, 5 points will be awarded and after answering all 20 questions a new page will appear showing the final score and offering an option to repeat the game.

## UX

I've included pictures as background, a different colour in some buttons and hover effects to showcase a little of my CSS abilities, however I've mostly chosen to style this project in a neutral and basic look, easy to use so it would not distract the users. As its aim is to be used for professional training reasons, it helps to keep the users focus in the quiz itself.

Colour pallet is as follows:
rgb(255, 255, 255), rgb(250, 229, 201), rgb(0,0,0)

## User Stories

## Wireframes

The wireframes helped as an initial plan of how I would like the Quiz to look like in terms of its structure. I have chosen not to include too much detail to keep it simple and easy to the eye. 
I have focused on the importance of making it easy to use, with a responsive website built. 
With that in mind, I have created two wireframes per page, one for larger screens and another one for smaller screens.
For this, I've used Balsamiq Wireframes, the links to the files are below:

- [quiz.js](https://github.com/Susafp/Allergens-Quiz-Milestone-two/blob/bb03e007b5a10beb9d1290bbbf301cd85860e094/js/quiz.js)
- [end.js](https://github.com/Susafp/Allergens-Quiz-Milestone-two/blob/bb03e007b5a10beb9d1290bbbf301cd85860e094/js/end.js)


## Technologies Used

- [**Balsamiq**](https://balsamiq.com/)
    - I've used **Balsamiq** to create my Quiz app wireframes.
- [**HTML5**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5)
    - The project uses **HTML5** to create the basic elements and content of my quiz.
- [**Bootstrap v4.3**](https://getbootstrap.com/)
    - The project uses **Bootstrap v5.2** to add a responsive grid system, prebuilt components, plugins built on jQuery, and Bootstrap styles to my website, before adding my custom styles.
- [**CSS3**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS3)
    - The project uses **CSS3** to add custom styles to the elements and content of the quiz app.
- [**jQuery**](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **jQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation. This is the standard jQuery that is built with Bootstrap components.
- [**JavaScript**](https://www.javascript.com/)
    - I have used **JavaScript** required to add functionality to the quiz and to achieve the final score presented in the 'End page'. Bootstrap also added already embedded JavaScript code to this project.
- [**Font Awesome**](https://fontawesome.com/)
    - The project uses **Font Awesome** for the social media links on the Quiz app.
- [**Visual Studio Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
    - I've used **Visual Studio Code** as the development environment to write the code for my website.
- [**Git**](https://git-scm.com/)
    - I've used **Git** as a version control system to regularly add and commit changes made to project in Visual Studio Code, before pushing them to GitHub.
- [**GitHub**](https://github.com/)
    - I've used **GitHub** as a remote repository to push and store the committed changes to my project from Git. I've also used GitHub pages to deploy my website in a live environment.

## Testing

### Testing User Stories

I used my user stories and documented each of the steps that each user would need to accomplish what they have stated. Below is the link to the document that contains this information:

- [Testing User Stories](https://github.com/Susafp/Allergens-Quiz-Milestone-two/blob/42e11a724e35d84a58eab69a9a16b1132d132ed1/testing-documents/testing.pdf)

### Responsive Testing

I've mainly used Microsoft Edge's Development tools to constantly test each change that I made to my website and to ensure that it appeared in the desired way on different screen sizes (mobile, tablet and desktop). I also tested my website with Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox.
### HTML, CSS and JavaScript Code Validation

To test my whole project, I went through each page and tested it feature by feature, used:

- [W3C HTML Validator tool](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) to validate my HTML code.

- [W3C CSS Validator tool](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input) to validate my CSS code.

- [Code Beautyfy JavaScript Validator tool](https://codebeautify.org/jsvalidate) to validate my JavaScript code.


### Bugs or Problems

- **Missing closing tags** - I was missing one 'div' closing tag in the body content of *Quiz* page. 
- **Hover effect on *Quiz* page** - When on small screen devices, the hover effect set for the ".choice-container" was misbehaving. The shadowing of the previous clicked choice was still somehow visible even after being populated with the next options. This could affect or wrongly influence the users on their next choice of answer.
This problem was fixed by adding a @media screen to disable the box-shadow hover effect for screens with a width smaller than 575px.
- **404 error returned instead of *End* page** - After deployment to GitHub, instead of rendering the 'end.html' page a 404 error was coming up. As after several attempts I still did not find a way to fix this I asked for Mentor assistance. Scott Nnaghor helped me find and fix the problem; a semi-column was missing in the JavaScript code to return end.html when reaching the end of all available questions.
- **unexpected 'const' *quiz.js*** - When testing JavaScript code
with Code Beautyfy JavaScript Validator tool, it accused 2 errors for *quiz.js*:
"Unexpected 'const', const question = document.getElementById('question');", and
"Stopping. (0% scanned)".
Did not find the solution for this errors, maybe in the future, with more experience I will.
Similar appeared with Firefox debugger ('getNewQuestion' line-282, 'startQuiz' in line-189, and 'anonymous' in line-265)

## Deployment

The hosting platform that I've used for my project is GitHub Pages. To deploy my website to GitHub pages, I used the following steps:

1. Loaded the terminal window in my Visual Studio Code workspace.
2. Initialised Git using the `git init` command.
3. Added all files to the Staging area (Git) using the `git add .` command.
4. Committed the files to Git using the `git commit -m "Initial commit"` command.
5. Created a new repository in GitHub called 'JS-Milestone-two'.
6. Copied the below code from GitHub into the terminal window in my Visual Studio Code workspace:

```git remote add origin https://github.com/Susafp/Allergens-Quiz-Milestone-two.git```
```git push -u origin master```

7. Entered my GitHub username and password to push the files from Git to GitHub.
8. Went into 'Settings' on my repository page in GitHub.
9. Selected the 'master branch' option under the 'GitHub Pages' section.
10. Ran several regular commits throughout my project.
