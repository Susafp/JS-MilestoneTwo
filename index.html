                        <b>Why is it important to know more about allergens?</b><br>
                        Many thousands of people, both children and adults, have allergies, 
                        and it’s important that they’re able to go about their day-to-day lives in safety, 
                        which means that those working with food need to be equipped with the right knowledge. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="modal-text">
                        <b>What is a food allergy?</b><br>
                        Food allergy occurs when a person’s immune system reacts inappropriately to a food. 
                        The first stage of the process is called sensitisation – when the immune system’s “memory” 
                        registers the food as a threat. Antibodies to that food are produced, and at a subsequent 
                        encounter, these antibodies connect with the food’s proteins and trigger the release of 
                        certain substances in the body, such as histamine. This results in an allergic reaction. 
                        </p>

                        <b>What is Anaphylaxis?</b><br>
                        Anaphylaxis is a severe and often sudden allergic reaction. It can occur when someone 
                        with allergies is exposed to something they are allergic to (known as an allergen). 
                        Reactions usually begin within minutes and rapidly progress but can occur up to 2-3 hours later.
                        Anaphylaxis is potentially life-threatening and always requires an immediate emergency response. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="modal-text">
                        An allergic response may range from mild or moderate symptoms to a more severe reaction. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="modal-text">
                        <b>Mild symptoms include:</b><br>
                        Nettle rash (otherwise known as hives or urticaria) or tingling or itchy feeling in the mouth. 
                        </p>
                        <p class="modal-text">
                        <b>More serious symptoms</b> for some people, including children: <br>
                        Abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting,
                        Widespread flushing of the skin, 
                        Nettle rash (otherwise known as hives or urticaria), 
                        Swelling of the skin (known as angioedema) anywhere on the body,  
                        Swelling in the face, lips, tongue, throat and/or mouth, 
                        Difficulty swallowing,
                        Faintness, drowsiness, dizziness,
                        Difficult or noisy breathing, wheeze, persistent cough, 
                        Severe asthma, 
                        In some cases there is a dramatic fall in blood pressure (<b>anaphylactic shock</b>). 
                        This is where the person may become weak and floppy and may have a sense of something terrible happening. 
                        This may lead to collapse and unconsciousness.
